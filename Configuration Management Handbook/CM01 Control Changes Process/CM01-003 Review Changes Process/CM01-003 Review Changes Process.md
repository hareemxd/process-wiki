#### Change Board

Since customer approval is a common requirement to release ECOs, the company designates employees to communicate with customer **Points of Contact** (POCs) on a regular basis. All product/project development teams under contract must form a **Change Board** comprised of these individuals who are accountable for providing guidance to the customer throughout the change process. The table below lists common examples of functions in this role and their responsibilities\.

| Function                    | Responsibility     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Project Engineer|Ensure changes are estimated and implemented correctly|
| Supply Chain | Ensures complete flow of requirements to/from vendors/suppliers/manufacturers |  
| Program Manager| Ensures changes are implemented on plan (schedule/cost)|

 The Change Board is the primary customer interface in the Revision Control process and ensures the customer understands and agrees to all technical and programmatic aspects of changes.
