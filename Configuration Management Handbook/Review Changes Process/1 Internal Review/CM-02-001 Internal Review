### Purpose
This document defines the procedure(s) and presents the common use cases and best practices to perform engineering internal reviews. 
### Definition
**Engineering Internal Review** is the practice of engineers of the same discipline, function, or team reviewing each other's work. It is the foremost review in the overall change process that ensures work is consistent with the internal group's standards and is free of objective errors like incorrect typos decimal placements or units of measurement. 

Internal reviews may be informal and conducted verbally or via email. However, for data that is subject to rigorous quality assurance requirements, it is *strongly recommended* to use an **Internal Review Checklist** with specific criteria to guide the review. See **CM-RC-001 Schematic Review Checklist** for an example.
### When to perform Engineering Internal Review

Any changes to data must be internally reviewed prior to the data's submittal for **Peer Review**.

### Best Practices
***
#### Review artifacts should be under change control
Providing teammates with uncontrolled changes to review could lead to misidentification of the review artifact. Data should be clearly identified to reviewers with a version or revision number. 

#### Submitted work should be ready for review

You should only submit an artifact for review if you believe it is ready to be reviewed by a non-internal audience (e.g., during **Peer Review**). Do not submit artifacts with incomplete or inconsistent changes for review unless explicitly directed.

#### Provide instructions to reviewers

Reviews are more effective when the reviewer knows what to look for. Ask reviewers to double-check specific items, tables, or pages. Provide helpful context like, *these changes were driven by* [X].


### Engineering Internal Review Procedure

#### Owner
1. Perform modifications to data. If using a Digital Engineering Tool, check in your changes; see **CM-01-001 Version Control**.
   
2. Send a link to the modified data to (at least) one reviewer, as well as any review instructions.

#### Reviewer
   
3. Review the data and record any findings.
4. Send findings to the Owner. Or, if there are no findings, notify the Owner that your review is complete.
