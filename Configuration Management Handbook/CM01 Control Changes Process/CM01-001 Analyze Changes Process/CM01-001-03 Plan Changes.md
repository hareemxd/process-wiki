### Purpose
This document defines the procedure(s) and best practices to plan engineering changes.

### Definition
Planning is the third step of the **Analyze Changes** process. Planning creates an implementation roadmap for the changes by assigning priority and release states of the **Affected Items**.

### When to use Plan Changes
The Owner of the change must use this procedure when submitting Engineering Change Requests (ECRs). 

Review Board members tasked with reviewing ECRs should use this procedure as reference.

### Best Practices

#### Prioritize Schedule Drivers
You should prioritize the changes that significantly influence scheduled activities (production, procurement, testing).

#### Review Applicable Control Procedures
You should reference **CM01-002 Perform Changes**, **CM01-003 Review Changes**, and their subordinate procedures, to support change planning estimates.
### Plan Changes Procedure

1. Identify the **Affected Items** of the change.
2. For each item, identify the current ("from") and future ("to") version, revision, or configuration numbers.

**Document Control**
