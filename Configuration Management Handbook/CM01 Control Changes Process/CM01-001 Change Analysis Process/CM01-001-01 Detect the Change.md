RTCs fall into one of two categories:
* **Corrective Action** to address a product defect
* **Improvement** to capitalize on an opportunity  


Corrective Actions can originate internally (Quality, Manufacturing) or externally (Customer, Vendor). Improvements almost always originate from internal stakeholders or processes.
