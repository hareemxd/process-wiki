When data must be reverted to a previous state, the commit messages in the version history help pinpoint the right version to restore. |
| SHOULD | C:/Users/Owner/Documents/process-wiki/process-wiki/Configuration Management Handbook/CM-00 Templates/T-04 Document Templates/Procedure Template.md | 55 | Versions are considered smaller increments of change than other control methods like **revisions** or **baselines**. Since the goal of version control is to produce a comprehensible change history, you should limit the changes in a single version to only a few significant changes or a handful of minor changes. This approach allows an independent reviewer to quickly grasp the evolution of the file. |
| MAY | C:/Users/Owner/Documents/process-wiki/process-wiki/Configuration Management Handbook/CM-00 Templates/T-04 Document Templates/Procedure Template.md | 57 | If you can't summarize the changes in 1-2 sentences in the commit message, the changes may be too complex or dense to be understood in the change history. Revert some of the changes, create a first new version, and then create a second new version with the remaining changes. |
| SHOULD | C:/Users/Owner/Documents/process-wiki/process-wiki/Configuration Management Handbook/CM-00 Templates/T-04 Document Templates/Procedure Template.md | 61 | You should not check out files unless your immediate attention will be devoted to completing the new version. Leaving a file in check-out status for many hours leaves teammates in the dark on your progress, and you may forget what work was left incomplete. Poor version control practice is unprofessional, slows down collaboration, and degrades the quality of the change history (e.g., a version with only a few typo fixes was checked out for 7 hours).

| MAY | C:/Users/Owner/Documents/process-wiki/process-wiki/Configuration Management Handbook/CM-00 Templates/T-04 Document Templates/Procedure Template.md | 65 | At certain pivot points in development, (e.g. scope of work change, requirements change), it may be necessary to create a new version with a substantial amount of change from the previous version. This is acceptable so long as the change history is still comprehensible and legibile, **and** the Commit Message for the major version includes an external record ID, such as a **Problem Report** or **Trouble Report**. |
| MAY | C:/Users/Owner/Documents/process-wiki/process-wiki/Configuration Management Handbook/CM-00 Templates/T-04 Document Templates/Procedure Template.md | 83 | Certain files may require a **commit approval step**. |

| SHOULD | C:/Users/Owner/Documents/process-wiki/process-wiki/Configuration Management Handbook/CM01 Control Changes Process/CM01 Control Changes.md | 38 | While a change such as a cable consists of only one redline to a Bill of Materials (BOM), the nature of the change (converting from RS232 to RS485) can drive updates to other parts or assemblies. Particularly when scoping changes to assemblies, you should review any sub-assembly drawings on the Parts List and all **Where Used** references of the assembly. These details provide full context for analyzing the change. |
| SHOULD | C:/Users/Owner/Documents/process-wiki/process-wiki/Configuration Management Handbook/CM01 Control Changes Process/CM01 Control Changes.md | 42 | You should prioritize higher level changes due to downstream effects that could interfere with or obsolete lower level changes. The high-level definition of change should be settled on before attempting to resolve Class II or III changes beneath it. |
| MAY | C:/Users/Owner/Documents/process-wiki/process-wiki/Configuration Management Handbook/CM01 Control Changes Process/CM01 Control Changes.md | 46 | Low level changes that do not conflict may be combined with higher level changes. If an assembly is being revised and its DWG file updated for the new revision, any Class III changes raised against the DWG file can be incorporated into the Engineering Change Order (ECO) with a Problem Report number. |

| SHOULD | C:/Users/Owner/Documents/process-wiki/process-wiki/Configuration Management Handbook/CM01 Control Changes Process/CM01-001 Analyze Changes Process/CM01-001-01 Classify Changes.md | 56 | When you assess changes with incomplete information (unknown external interface specification), or if the class is difficult to determine, you should assign Class I to the change. This approach ensures that all potential FFF impacts are routed correctly. |

Do not keep files unlocked for long periods of time. Revert changes and lock in the file if you don't have time to finish the version. |

Providing teammates with uncontrolled changes to review could lead to misidentification of the review artifact (review the wrong item, or incorporate findings into the wrong item). |
