**Procedure**  
Peer Review Procedure for Controlled Engineering Data
-----------------------------------------------------

## **Applicable Domains:** Engineering, Configuration Management

### 1. Purpose

This document defines the procedure for conducting peer reviews of controlled engineering data. Peer reviews are critical quality control activities that support traceability, accountability, and early defect detection in engineering projects.

### 4. Scope

This process applies to peer reviews conducted across all engineering data types and repositories, including documents, CAD, ECAD, system models, requirements, and source code. The process ensures peer review records are structured, role-driven, and integrity-preserving.

Peer reviews are a critical step of the major change process, being functionally equivalent to an "item-level internal design review". Peer reviews should generally be limited to one major item revision and should be sequenced in a way that maintains configuration integrity. For example, a complex assembly revision should occur **only** afer any required revisions of its sub-assemblies have been released.

For items/changes of sufficient complexity (e.g. multiple form-fit-function-interface changes to an assembly at multiple product levels), peer reviews should be coordinated between Engineering and Configuration Management with a Configuration Control Board review process.

### 5. Procedure

#### Step 1: Choose Appropriate Template

* Select a Peer Review Form (PRF) template suited to the target repository or artifact type.

  * Example: Use the SharePoint PRF template for documents in SharePoint.

#### Step 2: Identify the Modified Data Under Review

* In the PRF template, record the **part number** and **revision/increment number** for each data item under review.

**Note**: Identification fields must be data-validated from a reference list to reduce risk of typographical errors (see CM-02-002).

#### Step 3: Collect Data and Supporting Material

* Gather all relevant modified files, the PRF sheet, and any reference documentation required by reviewers.
* Upload all materials to a designated **shared folder**.

#### Step 4: Identify Reviewers

* Identify reviewers based on:

  * The **Authorized Signature List (ASL)** if available, or
  * **Manual assignment** by the data Owner or Engineering Lead.

**Reviewer assignment guidance:**

* Consider the **stage of the project lifecycle** (e.g., omit manufacturing review from early prototypes).
* Consider the **artifact type** (e.g., schematics need electrical review).
* Consider **system complexity** and **safety criticality** to determine needed domain participation.

Reviewer assignments and general approval structure for a project should be detailed in a project Configuration Management Plan. See CM-01-001 Approve Changes.

#### Step 5: Prepare Peer Review Record

* Populate the PRF with:

  * Configuration IDs (step 2)
  * Reviewers (step 4)
  * Change Description
* Notify reviewers and Configuration Management that the review has been initiated.

#### Step 6: CM Grants Reviewer Access

* CM grants reviewers **edit access** to the PRF.
* Access permissions must align with CM-02-001 Set Up Permissions for Data Repositories.

#### Step 7: Reviewer Commenting

* Reviewers analyze the data and enter comments directly into the PRF.
* **Reviewer guidance:**

  * Focus on the **modifications** made since the last version/revision.
  * Prioritize feedback on **domain-specific elements** relevant to their role.
  * Use clear, constructive language. Flag safety, performance, or compliance concerns.

#### Step 8: Owner Responds to Comments

* The data owner reviews each comment and records a **response**:

  * Accept and implement change
  * Reject with rationale
  * Defer or clarify as needed
* Data is modified as required to address valid feedback.

#### Step 9: Owner Closes Comments

* Once feedback is addressed, the owner **closes** each comment individually.
* Closed comments should reflect completion and traceability of action.

#### Step 10: Review Completion

* The PRF status changes from **Open** to **Closed** once:

  * All assigned reviewers have submitted at least one comment.
  * All comments are reviewed and responded to.
  * All comments are closed by the Owner.
  * All necessary data updates have been made.

---

### 6. Compliance

* All peer reviews must follow this procedure to ensure integrity, consistency, and approval traceability.
* CM must retain completed PRFs for audit and process verification.
* Incomplete or improperly executed reviews are not valid for release or revision.
