### Purpose
This document defines the Change Control process for Engineering data.
### Definition
Change Control is the process of managing changes to Engineering data. Change Control encompasses the required activities to record, review, approve, and implement Engineering changes across all levels of the product and/or program.  
### When to use Change Control
This process must be followed whenever performing changes to Engineering data.

## Process
###  Change Hierarchy

Engineering changes can vary from an updated torque value on a part drawing, to a new revision of a Requirements Specification that must be flowed down the entire product/document tree. Change Control requires an understanding of different change levels, relationships between affected items, and how they are properly managed from start to finish.
