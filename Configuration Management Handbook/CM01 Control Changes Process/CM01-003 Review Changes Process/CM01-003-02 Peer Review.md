### Purpose
This document defines the procedure(s) to perform peer reviews and supports compliance to the company's Quality Management System. 
### Definition
**Peer Review** is the practice of teammates reviewing each other's work to ensure it is complete, compliant to all applicable standards, and ready for external use.

Peer Review adopts a *subjective* lens for evaluating work. Instead of hunting for obvious mistakes, reviewers are expected to think critically about the work they are reviewing and apply their domain expertise. Common discussion topics surfaced during Peer Review include technical feasibility, downstream lifecycle aspects, design tradeoffs, and test strategies. These discussions drive additional improvements to the work prior to release. Additionally, and critically, Peer Review provides the opportunity to confirm across all stakeholder perspectives that the work is acceptable. The Owner may seek technical input from multiple stakeholders to fully verify the changes are **Release Ready**. 

Across industries governed by ISO 9001, Peer Review is a routine process requirement prior to delivery. Completing a Peer Review means the work is **Release Ready**. The review activity is structured to ensure work is complete, correct, and acceptable to all relevant stakeholders.


#### Objective
 This procedure ensures work is complete, compliant with all applicable standards, and technically prepared for delivery and/or use by an external party.
### When to perform Peer Review

Peer Review must be conducted on all Class I changes, and any work requiring the inputs of two engineering domains.

### Best Practices




### Peer Review Procedure

#### Owner
1. Perform modifications to data. If using a Digital Engineering Tool, check in your changes; see **CM01-002-01 Version Control**.
2. Send a link to the modified data to (at least) one reviewer, as well as any review instructions.
3. Resolve any review findings with the reviewer.
#### Reviewer
4. Review the data and record any findings.
5. If there are no findings, notify the Owner that the review is complete.
6. Send findings to the Owner.
