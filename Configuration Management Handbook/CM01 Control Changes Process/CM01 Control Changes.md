### Purpose
This document defines the Change Control process for company employees who manage, modify, or otherwise work with engineering data. The process facilitates alignment with the **Configuration Change Management** function of **EIA-649C Configuration Management Standard**. Append
### Definition
Change Control is the process of managing changes to Engineering data. Change Control encompasses the required activities to analyze, perform, review, and baseline Engineering changes across all levels of the product and/or program. Change Control is critical to establishing and maintaining product integrity (the product is developed, tested, manufactured, delivered, and serviced as described in the approved configuration baseline). 

This process, including all subordinate documents in the **Configuration Management Handbook**, provides clear and useful methods to control engineering data across the complete product lifecycle. As a business activity, Change Control begins at Contract Award and ends at product obsolescence, and it is applicable to all programs and contracts.
### When to use Change Control
This process must be followed whenever performing changes to Engineering data.

### Best Practices  

#### Establish clear baselines  



#### Define internal and external visibility of changes

#### Use Templates

### Process
#### Identify Reason for Change

Engineering changes can arise from many sources, some internal (Manufacturing, Quality, Supply) and others external (customer, vendor). Regardless of source, the reason for  change is only formalized once documented by Engineering in a **Problem Report**, which references the **Initiating Part Number** (IPN) (the part or item associated with the reason for change) and summarizes the reason for change.  
#### Analyze the Change
Changes must be analyzed from a holistic perspective, not in isolation, due to the complex, integrated, and multifaceted nature of our delivered systems, products, and services.

#### Perform the Change


#### Review the Change



#### Baseline the Change

### EIA-649 Configuration Change Management Principles  
|Number | Text |
| ----- | ---- |
|CCM-1	| Changes to an approved configuration are accomplished using a systematic, measurable change process. |
|CCM-2	| Justifying the need for a change provides the rationale to commit resources required to document, process, and if approved, implement the change. |
|CCM-3	| A unique change identifier enables tracking of the request for change and the status of implementation and verification of the approved change. |
|CCM-4	| Classification of a requested change determines the appropriate level of review and the applicable change approval authority. |
|CCM-5	| As the primary vehicle for referencing and managing a change, the request for change document must be clear and comprehensive from technical, cost and scheduling perspectives. |
|CCM-6	| Prior to approval, a requested change is evaluated for all impacts and risk considerations including technical, operational, support, schedule, and cost, as well as the consequences of not approving the request. |
|CCM-7	| After considering all impacts and risk factors, change approval decisions are made by an appropriate authority who can commit resources to implement the change. |
|CCM-8	| An approved change is implemented in accordance with documented direction approved by the appropriate level of authority. |
|CCM-9	| If it is necessary to temporarily depart from approved product configuration information, a request for variance is identified, classified, documented, coordinated, evaluated and dispositioned. |
