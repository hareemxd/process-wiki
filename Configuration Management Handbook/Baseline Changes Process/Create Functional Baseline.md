**Procedure**  
Create Functional Baseline
--------------------------

**Document Number:** CM-04-001  
**Applicable Domains:** Systems Engineering, Configuration Management, Program Management
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Purpose

This document defines the procedure to create a **functional baseline** (FBL) for a system.
  
  The FBL is the first formal configuration of the system and a key touchstone in early development. The complete baseline identifies and documents  system requirements, interface definitions, and functional architecture.

### 4. Scope

This process applies to the definition, documentation, and release of the functional baseline across engineering disciplines at the start of a program or major design cycle.

The functional baseline includes:

* System performance specifications (requirements)
* External interface specifications
* System functional architecture (e.g., functional block diagram)

---

### 5. Entry Criteria

Before initiating formal functional baseline creation, the following conditions must be met:

* A set of performance and external interface specifications has been acquired and validated by DRS as a valid representation of desired product behavior
* A peer-reviewed system functional architecture exists that covers the system-level requirements and reflects a valid implementation approach

### 6. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                         | Responsibility                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Program Management**       | Acquires and communicates customer requirements and interfaces; ensures they are robust and complete                     |
| **Systems Engineering**      | Translates requirements and interfaces into a peer-reviewed functional architecture; ensures requirements are verifiable |
| **Engineering Disciplines**  | Support systems engineering with domain-specific feasibility insight and architecture validation                         |
| **Configuration Management** | Coordinates with engineering to baseline all configuration items supporting the functional baseline                      |

#### Collaboration Notes:

* Program Management must recognize that Engineering requires **clear, verifiable, and complete** input to develop an effective functional baseline.
* Engineering must raise concerns about vague, unverifiable, or inconsistent requirements **early and consistently** to avoid downstream rework.

### 7. Process Overview

#### Step 1: Requirements and Interface Acquisition

* Program Management gathers system-level **performance** and **external interface** specifications from the customer.
* Engineering collaborates with PM to clarify ambiguities or non-verifiable requirements.

#### Step 2: Architecture Development

* Systems Engineering creates a **functional architecture** that decomposes and allocates all system-level requirements.
* The architecture is documented (e.g., block diagram, system model) and reviewed by relevant domain leads.

#### Step 3: Functional Baseline Package Assembly

* Configuration Management coordinates the collection of:

  * System performance requirements
  * External interface specifications
  * Peer-reviewed functional architecture
  * Any configuration items used to track or support the above (e.g., traceability matrix)

#### Step 4: Internal Review

* The proposed baseline is internally reviewed to ensure:

  * Requirements are covered and traceable
  * Architecture is sound and feasible
  * Documentation is properly formatted and versioned

#### Step 5: Formal Approval

* The functional baseline is presented to the customer at a **System Requirements Review (SRR)** or equivalent program milestone.
* Approval by the customer (formal or implied) is required to finalize the baseline.

#### Step 6: Release to Configuration Control

* Upon customer approval:

  * The functional baseline is released into the PLM system under revision control
  * Configuration items are distributed into relevant repositories per CM-04-003

---

### 8. Exit Criteria

The functional baseline is considered complete when:

* The customer has approved the requirements and functional architecture (typically at SRR)
* The baseline is formally entered into the PLM system
* All relevant configuration items are loaded into the appropriate data repositories (SharePoint, DOORS, Cameo, etc.)

---

### 9. Compliance

* Engineering must not proceed with design or verification planning based on assumptions; only the approved functional baseline is to be used.
* Any changes after baseline release require formal change control per CM-01-004.
* Configuration Management must retain version-controlled records of all baseline artifacts.
