### Purpose
This document defines the procedure(s) and presents the common use cases and best practices to perform internal reviews. 
### Definition
**Internal Review** is the practice of engineers of the same discipline, function, or team reviewing each other's work. It is the foremost review in the change process that ensures work is consistent with internal standards and free of objective errors, such as decimal placements or dimension format.

Internal Review can be informal (verbal or email) or highly formalized using  an **Internal Review Checklist** with specific criteria. Checklists also provide a ready-made format for recording all review activity items. See **CM-RC-001 Schematic Review Checklist** for an example.  

Each internal review activity should be recorded with the following data:
* Part Number and Revision
* Date of review start and close
* Review instructions
* Findings
* Resolutions
### When to perform Engineering Internal Review

Any changes to data must be internally reviewed prior to the data's submittal for **Peer Review**.

### Best Practices
***
#### Review artifacts should be under change control
Providing teammates with uncontrolled changes to review could lead to misidentification of the review artifact (review the wrong item, or incorporate findings into the wrong item). Data should be traceable with a version or revision number. 

#### Submitted work should be ready for review

You should only submit an artifact for review if you believe it is ready to be reviewed by a non-internal audience (e.g., during **Peer Review**). Do not submit artifacts with incomplete or inconsistent changes for review unless explicitly directed.

#### Provide instructions to reviewers

Reviews are more effective when the reviewer knows what to look for. Ask reviewers to double-check specific items, tables, or sheets. Provide helpful context like, *these changes were driven by* [X].

### Engineering Internal Review Procedure

#### Owner
1. Perform modifications to data. If using a Digital Engineering Tool, check in your changes; see **CM-01-001 Version Control**.
   
2. Send a link to the modified data to (at least) one reviewer, as well as any review instructions.
3. Resolve any review findings with the reviewer.

#### Reviewer
   
4. Review the data and record any findings.
5. If there are no findings, notify the Owner that the review is complete.
6. Send findings to the Owner.
