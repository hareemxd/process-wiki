### Purpose
This document defines the procedure(s) and best practices to classify engineering changes.

### Definition
Change Classification is the first step of the **Control Changes** process. Classification helps estimate effort and identify required stakeholders and procedures for implementation.  

**Class 1 Changes** are any changes affecting the **Form, Fit, Function** (FFF) of the product. **Class 2 Changes** are changes with no **FFF** impact. **Class 3 Changes** have no technical impact.

| Class                    | Criteria     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Class I "Major" |Form Fit Function design change|
| Class II "Minor" | Interchangeable Hardware, Documentation|
| Class III "Admin" | No technical impact

### When to use Classify Changes
Owners of changes must use this procedure when submitting Engineering Change Requests (ECRs). 

Review Board members tasked with reviewing ECRs should use this procedure as reference.
