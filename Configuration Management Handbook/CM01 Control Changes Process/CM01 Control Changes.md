### Purpose
This document defines the Change Control process for Engineering data.
### Definition
Change Control is the process of managing changes to Engineering data. Change Control encompasses the required activities to analyze, perform, review, and baseline Engineering changes across all levels of the product and/or program.  
### When to use Change Control
This process must be followed whenever performing changes to Engineering data.

### Best Practices  

#### Establish clear baselines  



#### Define visibility (internal, external) of changes

#### Use Templates

### Process
#### Identify Reason for Change

Engineering changes can arise from many sources, some internal (Manufacturing, Quality, Supply) and others external (customer, vendor). Regardless of source, the reason for  change is only formalized once documented by Engineering in a **Problem Report**, which references the **Initiating Part Number** (IPN) (the part or item associated with the reason for change) and summarizes the required change.  
#### Analyze the Change
Changes must be analyzed from a holistic perspective, not in isolation, due to the complex, integrated, and multifaceted nature of our delivered systems, products, and services.

#### Perform the Change


#### Review the Change



#### Baseline the Change
