mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,12,may,"Those who consider the small investment in the CM process a cost-driver may not be considering the compensating benefits of CM and may be ignoring or underestimating the cost, schedule, and technical risk of an inadequate or delayed CM process."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,14,must,"Since a major goal of acquisition streamlining is to use commercial and industry practices to the greatest extent possible, there is no single correct set of CM terminology that must be rigidly adhered to."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,17,should,"Configuration A collection of an item’s descriptive and governing characteristics that can be expressed in functional terms (i.e., what performance the item is expected to achieve) and in physical terms (i.e., what the item should look like and consist of when it is built)."

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,21,may,The same product-tracking base-identifier may be used for several similar items (usually defined by a common document) and requires that each such item is assigned serial or lot numbers distinct from each other such item.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,27,may,"The management and planning process may be constrained by a compressed time schedule for program execution, a lack of needed people and tools, or a lack of effective planning."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,27,may,It may also be constrained by contractual provisions which limit the Government configuration manager’s sphere of control.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,27,may,"Contractors are expected to have a robust configuration identification activity to define and baseline configuration documents and items at all levels, some of which may transition to Government configuration control depending upon applicable contract provisions."

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,28,may,Process validation by the Government in lieu of physical inspection may be appropriate.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,28,may,"Successful completion of verification and audit activities results in a verified product and documentation set that may be confidently considered a PBL, as well as a validated process that will maintain the continuing consistency of product to documentation."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,29,must,Requirements analysis: used to determine system technical requirements and provide verifiable performance-based requirements in the system utilization environments and top-level functional requirements that must be met by the system.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,29,must,It is conducted iteratively to define successively lower level functions; the lowest level yields a set of requirements that must be performed by components of the system to meet the top-level requirements.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,30,must,The maintenance concept defines many of the factors that must be addressed in a mature logistics system.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,30,may,"The maintenance plan includes the life cycle requirements for personnel, training, facilities, support equipment, supply support, and training devices and influences the information elements that may have to be provided to fully document an engineering change."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,31,should,"The support approach should maintain the desired configuration (form, fit, function, and interface), facilitate tracking of fielded units, provide necessary spares, meet contingency requirements, maintain the technical data, and provide upgrades and improvements that enhance system availability and lower life cycle cost."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,31,"must, needs to","The lowest equipment indenture level at which the maintenance concept determines that replacement is required, and for which the Government must order spares, determines the lowest level at which the Government needs to exercise configuration control."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,31,should,Configuration managers should envision future phases and determine what information in the current and immediately following phase should be captured to meet the needs of those future phases.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,32,should,Which specific information should the Government provide?
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,32,should,Which specific information should the contractor provide?
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,32,should,"The RFP should be compatible with the Government’s CM plan; however, the CM plan should have sufficient flexibility to enable the CM strategic goals to be met with a variety of responses from contractors."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,32,must,The RFP also must send the message to the contractor(s) that the Government is serious about CM.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,32,should,The proposal evaluation criteria (section L of the RFP) should have CM as a key management and past performance discriminator.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,32,should,"Its weighting should reflect the significance that an effective, documented contractor CM process can have in mitigating risk."

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,33,should,Objective oriented metrics should be collected throughout the progress of the entire phase or at least until the stated objectives are realized.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,33,should,"Since DCMA is the DoD agency that provides contract administration services and will interface with the contractor most directly on metrics and performance measurement issues, they should be involved as a full team member."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,33,should,"Ideally, all should agree upon a common set of objectives."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,33,should,Only a few critical items should be used at one time.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,33,should,"They should be designed to positively motivate, rather than keep score, and should be forward focused (i.e., “where are we going”), not merely a compilation of past history."

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,34,should,"Therefore, CM objectives and measurements cannot and should not be divorced from the interacting systems engineering, design engineering, logistics, contracting and other program objectives and processes."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,34,should,The process should be documented to a level of detail that is: a.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,34,must,Less detailed than the procedures used to perform the process but sufficient to determine what must be measured to obtain factual information on the process.

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,35,should,The Government’s configuration identification practices should be applied at the level necessary for effective identification and control based on the acquisition approach used and lifecycle phase.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,35,should,"Contractor practices in accordance with SAE EIA-649 should be applied to commercial items used in Government systems; to CIs whose performance requirements are allocated, approved, and controlled only by the contractor; and to items that are within the contractor’s design cognizance."

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,35,must,"To define and control the performance of a system or CI does not mean that all of its hardware and software components must be designated as CIs, nor does it mean that the performance requirements for the non-CI components must be under Government control."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,35,may,The requirements to be met by a lower-level component (which is not designated as a CI) may be established and controlled via the Contractor’s design and engineering release process.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,35,should,Initial CI selection should reflect an optimum management level during early acquisition.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,36,should,"However, there are many cases in which other lower-level items should also be selected based on the management needs of the program."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,36,must,Level at which interchangeability must be maintained.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,36,should,Government CI designation should reflect the optimum level for both acquisition and support.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,36,must,The selection of the appropriate specification document types is dependent upon a number of factors such as the maturity of the item and the context and environment in which it must operate.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,36,"should, may","Both the Government and contractors should seize opportunities at lower levels of the specification tree (where developed items, referred to as non-developmental items [NDI] may be used) to select higher preference specification types, and to specify only performance and interface requirements rather than design solutions in those specifications, whenever possible."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,37,may,"For hardware, the design documentation may be in the form of engineering drawings and associated lists and the material and process documents that are referenced by the drawings."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,37,may,"In the current information environment, the primary design documentation source may be in the form of two- or three-dimensional engineering models."

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,37,may,"Engineering drawings may or may not exist as a central part of the product manufacturing process, depending on the product and the degree of automation technology employed."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,37,should,"Where engineering drawings or models are required as a contract deliverable, they should be developed and delivered in accordance with MIL-STD-31000."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,37,may,"The process the contractor employs to manage the automated software documentation (i.e., software library management and archiving) is similar to the process used to manage automated hardware documentation, although different tools may be employed."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,37,may,"Where it is necessary for the Government to capture the detailed design, the contractor may map the information in his or her internal databases to the appropriate fields of the Government’s CM Automated Information System (AIS)."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,37,may,Some of this data may transition to Government configuration control and some of it may remain under contractor configuration control throughout the program life cycle.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,37,should,"Each and every version of all elements of the developmental configuration released, for whatever purpose, should be maintained along with the reasons the version was released and the rationale for superseding the previous version."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,38,should,The performance thresholds should be reflected in the system or top-level CI specification that constitutes the FBL for the program for those thresholds to be achieved.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,38,needs to,Each of these major configuration baselines is designated when the given level of the CI’s configuration documentation is deemed to be complete and correct and needs to be formally protected from unwarranted and uncontrolled change from that point forward in its life cycle.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,38,"must, may","Under MIL-STD-973 and earlier CM standards, these baselines all signified departure points for Government configuration control; they must now be redefined for post-acquisition reform application because either Government or contractor configuration control may apply."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,39,should,The Government should maintain configuration control authority only to the level necessary to ensure effective control and allow contractor configuration control authority below that level.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,39,"must, may","From the sub-contractor’s view, it is an FBL since it constitutes the top-level requirement that the sub-contractor must meet and which the sub-contractor may need to allocate further down the CI tree."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,40,may,It represents the contractor’s detailed design solution and may or may not include a detail specification for the product.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,40,may,"The contractor is responsible for the configuration control of the developmental configuration and may iteratively design, release, prototype, and test until the functional and allocated requirements are satisfied."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,40,may,"The PBL may include the 2-D or 3-D engineering model of a hardware product, and for software, it includes a representation of the CSCI source code."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,40,needs to,"The Government needs to take delivery of and control PCD at a level of detail commensurate with the operational, support, and re-procurement strategies for the given program."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,40,should,"The FCD, ACD, and PCD should be mutually consistent and compatible."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,40,should,Redundant documentation should be avoided to minimize the possibility of conflicts.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,40,should,"When viewed on a system basis, care should be exercised to assure that all of the top-level requirements are accounted for in individual lower-level documents."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,41,must,A document identification principle expressed in SAE EIA-649 is that each configuration document (as well as other documents) must have a unique identifier so that it can be associated correctly with the configuration of the item to which it relates.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,41,should,"In addition to the identification assigned to each document, the digital files for each version of each representation of the document and its component files should be identified and managed."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,41,"should, needs to","The contract should specify requirements for the assignment of Government type designators and Nomenclature to CIs for which the Government needs to control, track and provide logistic support."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,42,may,"For practical reasons, some employ a multi-detailing system in which the drawing number may detail several parts and assemblies."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,42,should,The significant criteria are as expressed in the principles above: The part number should uniquely identify the specific part.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,42,should,CIs should address the effectivity of subordinate parts and changes to subordinate parts.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,42,should,"NOTE: There are other ways of expressing the effectivity, particularly in commercial industry, but whether lot, block, fiscal year contract, date, or other term is used, it should translate as closely as possible to which serial numbered CIs will have the part installed."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,42,should,The issuance of Government serial numbers should be avoided where the contractor has an acceptable process for assigning unique serial numbers.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,42,may,"These shop serial numbers may or may not correspond directly to the serial numbers to be marked on parts or nameplates (delivery numbers), because for various reasons the shop units may not complete the manufacturing process in sequence, or some units in the flow may be sent to another customer."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,43,should,The contractor’s engineering release process should prevent all engineering releases related to a class I change to a Government approved document from being released until the Government has approved the class I change.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,43,should,Acquisition PMs should ensure that both Government activities and contractors follow engineering release procedures which record the release and retain records of approved configuration documentation (engineering release records).
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,43,may,"It may be that the revision level at release is higher than the initial release of a “rev dash” or may be a format that the Government and supplier have agreed to (e.g., putting the letter “X” in front of the revision until Government approval and release of product baseline)."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,43,should,"Detail design documents under contractor control should be kept current with all changes, modifications, and releases, including changes occurring as a result of test activity."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,43,may,The record of prior release and use history of configuration documentation represents the developmental history of the CI and may be needed to support cost trade-offs and the rationale for changes to design constraints.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,43,should,Release records should indicate superseded as well as superseding requirements at least until superseded configurations no longer exist.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,43,may,Superseded requirements may then be retained as historical information.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,43,should,The contractor’s release process should verify the approval/concurrence status of each class I or II change prior to the release of the related documentation for use in the generation of deliverable units.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,43,should,"The release process and released documentation should identify engineering changes, and retain a record of superseded configuration requirements which are/were incorporated into delivered CIs."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,43,may,"In addition, the Government may need additional design details prior to or at the end of production, depending upon a number of factors such as: a."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,44,may,"In an integrated data environment, selected information in a contractor’s release record may be shared by the Government or downloaded to a CM AIS."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,44,may,The actual documents also may be downloaded to the Government data repository.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,44,may,Acquisition PMs responsible for new systems may have interfaces with other systems.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,44,may,All of the interfaces between co-functioning items need to be identified and documented so that their integrity may be maintained through a disciplined configuration control process.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,44,should,"In some cases, a formal interface management process should be employed in order to define and document the interface."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,44,needs to,"If either item needs to be changed for any reason, its performance, functional, or physical attributes that are involved in the interface act as constraints on the design change."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,44,should,"To understand how a particular interface should be defined and managed, it is necessary to categorize the interface in a number of ways: a."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,44,should,"Each interface should be defined and documented; the documentation varies from performance or detailed specifications to item, assembly, or installation drawings to interface control documents/drawings."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,44,should,The simplest and most straightforward approach that will satisfy the above objective should always be chosen.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,44,should,Extravagant and complex interface management activity should only be undertaken when other methods are inappropriate.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,45,may,"However, where there is no contractual relationship, a separate interface agreement may be necessary to define the interface process and provide protection of proprietary information."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,45,may,"Within an organization, and often with subcontractors, IPTs may be used to establish interfaces."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,45,should,Some interfaces should be defined through a formal interface management process involving ICWGs.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,45,should,"Once interfaces have been agreed to by the parties concerned, they should be detailed at the appropriate level to constrain the design of each item and baseline the configuration documentation so that the normal configuration control process will maintain the integrity of the interface."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,45,may,Then it may be necessary to convene an ICWG or other mechanism on rare occasions to resolve change issues in a satisfactory manner.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,46,may,"Changes may be needed for a variety of reasons, such as to counter a new threat, insert new technology, and respond to technical and operational tests and evaluations or to correct problems."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,46,may,"As part of the systems engineering control process in this phase, there may be several informal requirements definition baselines established for convenience in assuring that all program participants are on the same page."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,47,may,The contractual configuration approval authority approving the implementation of a change to a product (system/CI) may initially reside with a contractor or with the Government.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,47,may,It may transfer from the contractor to the Government or may continue to reside with the contractor throughout the life cycle of the CI.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,47,may,"The CDCA may be a Government activity or a contractor, and its authority may be transferred."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,47,may,"There may be multiple configuration control authorities for a product with more than one user, each being a configuration approval authority for a given contract."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,47,may,"They cannot authorize change to either, but they may participate in the change control process if asked for input by either the configuration approval authority that is the CDCA or by the Government lead AA."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,47,should,"If it is not the CDCA for a given document, it does not have the authority to approve a proposed change to that document and, therefore, should solicit ECP approval from the applicable CDCA or select an alternate design."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,47,may,They may delegate this authority.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,47,should,"Variances are requested by producers (typically contractors) prior to manufacture, during manufacture, or after an item has been submitted for Government inspection and acceptance.1 In order to be tendered for delivery or to be installed in an item to be tendered for delivery, the deviant item should be suitable for use."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,48,should,Action should be taken by the Government to ensure that approved RFVs are rarely submitted on a recurring basis.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,48,"should, may, needs to",Recurring RFVs for the same item characteristic or issue should trigger Government concern that either corrective manufacturing action needs to be implemented by the contractor or that the CI’s technical requirements may be too stringent.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,48,should,"In the case of the latter, the Government should request a class I (major) ECP from the contractor for revising the CI’s current technical documentation."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,48,should,The FAR (46.407) specifies that the Government should accept “non-conforming material” only when it is in the Government’s best interests and there is appropriate consideration.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,48,should,"Based on the CCB review, the appropriate consideration to the Government resulting from RFV approval should be estimated and furnished to the contracting office for negotiation."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,48,should,"In addition, FAR (7.503) stipulates that approval of all RFVs (minor, major, or critical) is an inherently Governmental function and should not be delegated to Government support or defense contractors."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,48,should,CIs tendered for delivery with either approved Government or contractor RFVs should be suitable for their intended use without requiring subsequent repair or restoration at Government expense.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,48,may,"For ECPs to documents that are controlled by the ECP originator, a NOR may be used at contractor option."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,48,may,"Alternatively, the originator may describe the change to each document within the ECP."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,48,may,The inputs and outputs may be thought of as generic categories for which there are different specifics in each phase (see figure 7).
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,50,must,Some of the CSA information that often must be shared between the Government and contractors concerns items under warranty.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,52,should,Configuration verification should be an imbedded function of the contractor’s process for creating and modifying the CI or CSCI.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,52,may,Validation of this process by the Government may be employed in lieu of physical inspection where appropriate.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,53,may,Successful completion of verification and audit activities results in a verified system/CI(s) and a documentation set that may be confidently considered a PBL.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,53,should,"Once the initial configuration has been verified, approved changes to the configuration should also be verified."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,53,may,"Change verification may involve a detailed audit, a series of tests, a validation of operation, maintenance, installation, or modification instructions, or a simple inspection."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,53,should,"Under these circumstances, implementation planning should define the extent to which the change to each unit and support commodity is to be verified and the records to be maintained."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,53,should,"When materials, parts, or retrofit kits are ordered in incremental stages (e.g., per year, per month), the incremental ordering and supply actions should also be verified."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,must,"In general, a performance specification is used to define the essential performance requirements and constraints that the CI must meet."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,should,"However, the design activity should perform both performance (FCA) and design (PCA) audits on all CIs in the deliverable product, especially if the Government does not intend to conduct audits on those particular CIs (usually because the applicable configuration documentation is not [will not be] under Government configuration control)."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,should,"If the design activity is a Government entity, audits should be performed as all CIs will be under Government control."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,should,"The actual audit itself is the second phase, and the third is the post-audit phase in which diligent follow-up of the audit action items should take place."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,may,Audit of a CI may include incremental audits of lower-level items to assess the degree of achievement of requirements defined in specifications and documentation not controlled by the Government.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,may,"Each item may be subjected to separate functional and physical audits, or both audits may be conducted at the same time."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,may,"In some cases, especially for very large, complex CIs and systems, the audits may be accomplished in increments."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,may,Each increment may address a specific functional area of the system/CI and will document any discrepancies that are found in the performance capabilities of that increment.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,may,"After all of the increments have been completed, a final (summary) FCA may be held to address the status of all of the action items that have been identified by the incremental meetings and to document the status of the FCA for the system or CI in the minutes and certifications."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,may,"Although an FCA is only required once for each CI or system, a number of FCA-like activities may be accomplished at other times during the life cycle of the CI or system."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,should,The performance of each new design element should be verified to ensure that it will not degrade performance of the CI or system below the performance specified by its Government-controlled performance specification.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,54,may,The degree and type of verification will be included as part of the ECP; it may vary from a simple analysis of the similarity to the old design to a lengthy program of testing similar to the original verification testing accomplished during the EMD phase.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,55,may,"If the Government is controlling the detailed design, a production contract may require a “first article” inspection to be accomplished."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,55,may,An ECP or a new contract may call for the development of a new CI(s) and incorporation of the new CI into the system via a modification program.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,55,may,Additional PCAs may be accomplished later during CI production if circumstances such as the following apply: a.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,55,may,"It does not focus on the results of the operational testing that is often accomplished by operational testing organizations in the services, although some of the findings from the operational testing may highlight performance requirements in the baselined specification that have not been achieved."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,56,should,"But all product related data should be determined to be required, then acquired, stored, and made available for use by Government employees and others."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,57,should,"As shown in figure 9, each of the above drive up life cycle weapon system acquisition and sustainment costs, which should be considered any time trade-off decisions are made relative to the acquisition of needed data."

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,59,should,Only if all three are found to be in compliance with contract and specification requirements should the Government accept the data deliverable.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,59,should,"Once received, the data (CM or otherwise) should be stored and managed in an IT system, preferably some type of product DM system containing CM functionality."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,59,should,The Government should have a contract vehicle in place and fund the contractor to provide that service.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,59,may,"If the Government contracts with a contractor to store our data and then the contract ends for any reason, the Government may have a very short period of time and limited ability to prepare for transferring the data to an organic DM system."

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,60,should,"It is, therefore, critical from a CM standpoint to know which instance of the data set is to be considered the “master” or “authoritative source” and which others are considered “copies.” All master instances of the data should be identified as such and configuration controlled."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,60,should,Any change to the master should be communicated to the owners of any copies so they can determine the impact of the changed master to their data copy.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,60,should,Any changes made to the “master” CAD model should result in the transformed 2D drawing representation being regenerated so both forms of the data are kept in sync.

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,61,should,"If the viewpoints remain in the digital environment, CM controls should be in place to maintain continuity of the dataset contained in that particular viewpoint to ensure proper continuity of the model."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,61,must,CM must therefore include a formal change management process that provides traceability of any changes made to a data set.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,62,should,"The CM and PM communities should recognize this new data need and work with our industry partners to develop methods to acquire, manage, and maintain this new and very voluminous set of product configuration information to enable the life cycle digital thread benefits."

mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,63,should,"The use of COTS/NDI can provide significant opportunities for efficiencies during system development but can also introduce certain issues regarding intellectual property rights, single sources of supply, and possible future parts obsolescence that should be considered and mitigated for programs to realize expected benefits."
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,63,should,MOSA should be included as one of the evaluation criteria for contract proposals.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,63,should,RFPs and other contract language can be leveraged to obtain appropriate data and data rights in support of a program’s MOSA implementation strategy and should be facilitated by CM.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,63,should,CI level requirements addressing interfaces that compose the system for each build or increment should be managed.
mil-hdbk-61b.pdf,63,may,Framework and interfaces for MOSA architecture may be considered when establishing CIs.
